# MScADS_Hackathon
### Team
**Jean-Sebastien Gaultier** - Current Master in Applied Data Science Student at the University of Chicago

## Challenge
This Hackathon was organised by the Master of Science in Applied Data Science Program from The University of Chicago from June 27th to July 2nd. The goal being to: "Develop a Gen AI application using foundational models (LLM & MLLM) to enhance the analysis of unstructured (text & image), semi-structured (i.e. CSV), and structured data (i.e. tables), such as research papers, financial and medical mixed data documents. This will help organizations improve the quality of their analysis, boost productivity, and streamline workflows." 


## Problem Statement
### For Hospitals
- **Goal**: Leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) to reduce the average wait time in Emergency Rooms (ER) by assisting doctors in quickly assessing patient conditions.
- **Background**: According to an article published on October 5th, 2023, by Employee Benefit News, the average wait time for Americans in the ER exceeds 2 hours and 25 minutes. Long wait times in the ER can lead to increased patient discomfort, delayed treatments, and overall strain on healthcare resources.
- **Challenge**: Develop a solution that utilizes an LLM to assist doctors by linking the current patient's symptoms with similar past cases. This could enable faster and more accurate preliminary assessments, ultimately reducing the overall time patients spend in the ER.
- **Advantages**:
  - Reduce wait time in the ER
  - Create a centralised database to easily access historical patient data (i.e. How many diabetic patient's were met this year?)
